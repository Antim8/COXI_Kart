# COXI_Kart
### Welcome to the most realistic Arcade Racer of 2022 (At least if you yourself are a polygon of 6 edges)!

This is a somewhat 3D Racer with rainbow special effects and an extra dose of Coxi.
You can experience the glorious amount of two hand created maps with teleporters, speed-boosts and turrets that will mostlikely bully you!
(One of which is in kinda beta mode because of the time it takes to create the objects in Blender). 


## Requirements
- Unity 2021.3.3f1
- System Requirements:
  - If you can see this it is powerfull enough

## How does it work?
To play the game you can either run it in Unity or Build it for your system and run the built version.
You will be prompted with a Main Menu Screen where you have three options:
- Start
- Settings
- Quit

On Start you will come to a selection of which map you would like to play, either the Platypus Highway (our finished track) or the HillBilly road (not so finished track).

In the settings you can choose if you would like to play in fullscreen, wheter you want vsync to be activated, and you can choose between the resolutions 720p and 1080p.

Quit quits the game.

### Ingame Controls

- The car can be driven by WASD to go forward/backward and steer left and right
- You can press R to be resetted to a checkpoint
- You can press ESC to get back to the Mainmenu

## Development history

We started with the idea to have a small racer that the player could race a given track with jumps etc to make it a bit more fun.

The first steps were getting a car driveable, for that went through a number of Car versions until we found one that feels rather natural (physics wise).
In the beginning we only had a cube that could steer and go forwards and backwards but without acceleration/deceleration and a horrible collision concept.
With that we already tested the speed boosts and the shells that can be seen in the HillBilly road.

In the second version we had a cube that at least looked like a car, that had a real acceleration/deceleration, features like drag and grip; which made it feel far better that our cube of terrors in the first try. You can still take a look at it and drive if you want in the CarV2 Scene in Unity. It was cool but we tricked the system and made up our own system for drag grip etc. which was ok but not really satisfying enough. This is where ...

The CarV3
comes in. This time we modelled a car in blender and gave it real world measurements which looked far better than our little cuby-drivers. For this we also modelled wheels which are the main and most important differences to the other tries. The power of the car comes from the wheels turning and making contact to the ground with values for when the tire looses its grip etc. TL DR: We started making use of the physics engine and our car started moving by the same principles real cars do.

After having the car up and running we built our Platypus Highway (The Coxi circuit).
First we tried to model it in Unity but it doesn't even look half as nice as if done in Blender. And so we began the journey of building a racetrack in Blender by using modular pieces and putting them together to get our letter-tracks. Since that is really time consuming we only did it for the main track. The second track (HillBilly road) is still kind of in beta mode and therefore only modelled in Unity to first get the functionality right. More on that later.
We then imported the tracks into Unity, lined them up, tweaked the scales, added our car, teleporters, a finding beacon a number of UI elements to know what to do and a pinch of pepper and salt, et voila Track rdy to be played. (Kind of sounds easier than it felt like).

Next to that we created our Main Menu inspired by the tutorial of gamesplusjames, mentionned at the top.
We mainly used his font throughout the entire game and used his particle system to create our own stylish ones.

Lastly we worked on the HillBilly road which should be a fun arcade like track with many moving objects, speed boosts, shooting turrets etc. It looks like you would expect a pre-alpha to look like, but it is what it is. At least it works without crashing all the time, better than some tripple A games out there. Yes Cyberpunk I am looking at you. 
Although the maps was set to be "fun" it depends on your understanding of fun really. If you like a challenge: Welcome! Otherwise you will feel what I meant by writing that the turrets will "bully" you.

And thats where the journey ends (at least for now, for the project).
We had a lot of fun making it and really enjoyed diving into game development and will most likely do more with Unity in the future, especially with the AI Toolkit I think, since we are really into Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

We hope you enjoyed it all, and until then farewell!
Yours Tim and Tim
